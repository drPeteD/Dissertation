### Abstract

Transportation of freight by rail is an exceptionally fuel efficient mode. Rail’s exceptional
efficiency comes with a high cost for inspection and maintenance of the railway to ensure train
safety at design speed. The Federal Railroad Administration imposes operational safety by requiring
compliance with regulations which rely on timely track inspection.
Further, new standards for train movement authority, known collectively as positive train control,
require knowledge of a train’s exact location on the railway. This knowledge has traditionally
relied on wired track circuits due to the need to distinguish a train’s location on two or more parallel
tracks.

The research examines a technology to augment signals from navigation satellites in real time,
available from many state governmental agencies at little or no cost, yet proclaimed by the US Department
of Transportation in 2008 as “unsuitable for transportation applications”. The successful
application of this technology may enable rail companies to inspect the trackway with greater safety
at lower cost, and enable train location determination systems in positive train control independent
of wired track circuits.

The results of three experiments conducted within the safety and access constraints of a Class
I railroad are presented. The first surveys a 58 track hump yard by locomotive during production
operations. The second determines horizontal track alignment over 29 miles of mainline track using
inspector’s Hi-Rail. The third experiment tests the hypothesis that RTK GNSS technology can
meet the FRA’s stringent requirement as a reliable indicator of track occupancy. The research
outcome suggests more efficient techniques for selected track inspection tasks, as well as a wireless
method to determine track occupancy.
