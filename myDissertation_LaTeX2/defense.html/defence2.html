Implications Simplified occupancy determination local to an LDS onboard a locomotive, Hi-Rail, or other track vehicle RTK receiver, communication with VRS, database, processor Self-determined RTK positions transmitted through wayside voice repeater enable real time tracking or track occupancy determination external to track vehicle Applicable  to any track vehicle Applicable to individual on-track workers Transportation Implications Highway: vehicle/human interaction Lane deviation alerts driver Air: Precision approach and landing To any airfield w/o barometric altimeter Waterway: River bed profile mapping &amp; water level for bridge clearance Civil &amp; Mining Engineering RTK VRS Networks enable Structure monitoring (further study: diurnal, seasonal) Bridge Dam Coal slurry impoundment Self-guided Vehicles"/>
