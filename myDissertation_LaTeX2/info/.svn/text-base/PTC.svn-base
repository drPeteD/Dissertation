Positive Train Control

Now that the FRA has released its final implementation rule on positive
train control (PTC), the clock is ticking: these systems must be
installed on the nation's major freight-rail lines, as well as commuter
and intercity passenger-rail routes by the end of 2015. And with an
estimated $5.5 billion price tag to install the technology on 160,000
track miles and on board 30,000 rail vehicles
