Observation correction type

Reason Corrections are derived from...

Solid Earth tides "Deformations of the solid Earth due to the body tides
arising from the direct effect of the external tide generating
potential" (mainly, the Moon). (See: IERS CONVENTIONS) An internal
model.

Ocean tidal loadings Deformations of the solid Earth due to the
"temporal variation of the ocean mass distribution and the associated
load on the crust". (See: IERS CONVENTIONS) A file:
ocean_tide_loading_grid.txt.

Pole tides The oscillation of the Earth's rotational axis around its
nominal direction results in an additional centrifugal force which
displaces the surface. (See: IERS CONVENTIONS) A file:
earth_orientation_params.txt.

Carrier phase wind-up Bias introduced into carrier-phase measurements
depending on the relative orientation of the GNSS receiver antenna with
respect to the satellite antenna (which changes as it orbits about the
Earth because the satellite always needs to be exposed to the sunlight)
as well as on the direction of the line of sight between them. (See:
J.T. Wu et al; "Effects of antenna orientation on GPS carrier phase";
Manuscripta Geodaetica, 19, 1993, pp. 91-98). An internal model.

Satellite phase center Offset of the antenna phase center of a satellite
to its center of mass and phase center variations. The satellite orbit
products are often the orbits of their centers of mass. The broadcast
orbits are orbits of the phase center itself. ANTEX files.
