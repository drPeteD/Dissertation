 EB1559.The horizontal coordinates were established by GPS observations
 EB1559.and adjusted by the National Geodetic Survey in February 2007.
 EB1559
 EB1559.The datum tag of NAD 83(2007) is equivalent to NAD 83(NSRS2007).
 EB1559.See National Readjustment <http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/NationalReadjustment> for more information.
 EB1559.The horizontal coordinates are valid at the epoch date displayed above.
 EB1559.The epoch date for horizontal control is a decimal equivalence
 EB1559.of Year/Month/Day.
 EB1559
 EB1559.The orthometric height was determined by differential leveling
 EB1559.and adjusted in June 1991.
 EB1559
 EB1559.The X, Y, and Z were computed from the position and the ellipsoidal ht.
 EB1559
 EB1559.The Laplace correction was computed from USDV2009 derived deflections.
 EB1559
 EB1559.The ellipsoidal height was determined by GPS observations
 EB1559.and is referenced to NAD 83.
 EB1559
 EB1559.The geoid height was determined by GEOID09.
 EB1559
 EB1559.The dynamic height is computed by dividing the NAVD 88
 EB1559.geopotential number by the normal gravity value computed on the
 EB1559.Geodetic Reference System of 1980 (GRS 80) ellipsoid at 45
 EB1559.degrees latitude (g = 980.6199 gals.).
 EB1559
 EB1559.The modeled gravity was interpolated from observed gravity values.
