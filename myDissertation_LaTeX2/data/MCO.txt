The long chord C from P.C. to P.T. is a valuable check, easily
determined with modern distance-measuring equipment. It is C = 2R sin
(I/2), where I the total central angle.

For the example, C = 2(2864.93)sin(8.433) = 840.32 ft.
The length of the curve, by stations, is 843.30 ft.
This figure can be checked by actual measurements in the
field. The actual arc length of the curve is (2864.93)(0.29437) = 843.34
ft. Note that this is the arc length on the centre line; for the rails,
use R Â± g/2, where g = 4.7083 ft = 56.5 in = 1435 mm for standard gauge.
