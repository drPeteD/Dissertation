\chapter{Introduction}
The shipment of freight by rail is an exceptionally efficient transportation mode. The average freight train consumes one gallon of diesel fuel to move one ton 423 miles~\citep{RITAtransStats08}. The outstanding efficiency of rail freight comes with a high price in inspection and maintenance of the railway. Rail car loading forces, weather, and time act on the railway and substructure to distort the track geometry. Distortions to the track geometry\footnote{i.e., gage, profile, alinement, crosslevel, superelevation, and warp.} must be identified and maintenance resources brought to bear to insure safe operation at the design track speed. 

FRA\footnote{Federal Railroad Administration} mandated visual track inspections rely on a rail company inspector's training, skill, and diligence. Conversely, track geometry car inspections provide an objective, detailed record of relative track position but are performed infrequently due to the limited availability of these specialized measurement systems. The thesis of this research is that, given a sufficiently accurate and reliable augmentation system, railway infrastructure measurement can be performed quickly, with greater safety, and at less cost by determining absolute track position using global satellite positioning systems. Survey-grade track measurement using GNSS\footnote{Global Navigation Satellite Systems} instrumentation will remove ground-based surveyors from the hazards inherent to active rail yards; enable monitoring of rail position changes during routine visual inspections; and determine the track occupancy of a train in parallel multi-track segments in signalized or dark territory, independent of wired track circuits.

The research results present an investigation into the use of Real Time Kinematic (RTK) augmentation to global satellite navigation systems in the measurement of absolute track position. Survey quality track positions enable the development and demonstration of solutions to rail measurement in an active hump yard and across 29 continuous miles of parallel mainline track.

Space vehicles (SV) that comprise the GPS\footnote{Sponsored by the United States Department of Defense (USDOD)}, as well as other global navigation satellite systems: GLONASS\footnote{GLObal'naya NAvigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema  sponsored by the Russian Space Forces}; Galileo\footnote{Sponsored by the European Union}; and the future CNSS\footnote{Compass Navigation Satellite System proposed by the Peoples Republic of China}, are orbiting reference beacons enabling autonomous geo-spatial positioning and timing across the globe. The geo-spatial positioning accuracy of these systems can be improved by augmenting the identifiable distortions to SV signal transmissions through the ionosphere and troposphere with corrections from ground based facilities. 

The use of GPS positioning for rail infrastructure measurement has depended on federal government supplied augmentation. The United Stated Department of Transportation (USDOT) has selected the National Differential GPS (NDGPS) augmentation system to increase accuracy in transportation applications. NDGPS has been promoted by the FRA as a means to achieve reliable track occupancy, however no NDGPS equipment demonstrating the requisite accuracy or reliability to insure track occupancy has been publicly demonstrated~\citep{2006AllenAssetMap}. The FRA reports that ``When [track occupancy is] viewed as a two dimensional area problem, it is unlikely that any economically feasible [GPS] system could achieve this accuracy to the required $0.9_5$ probability~\citep[pp.6-7]{1995FRADiffe}.''

\section{Railway Measurement Problems}
Track course smoothness must be held within specific tolerances to avoid undesirable lateral accelerations that lead to additional railway distortions and derailment. A system for track surveying should be cost-effective, provide relative accuracy without interfering with train traffic, and minimize exposure to railway hazards. Historically, North American railways use relative measurement methods for track inspection based on the idea that track curvature ($D_c$) irregularity can be determined by the versine\footnote{In rail transportation, versine refers to relationship between the distance ($v$) measured at right angles from the midpoint of a chord ($L$) to the arc, with the instantaneous  $D_c$ determined from $\displaystyle\lim_{L\to0} 8\frac{v}{L^2}$}.

The research applies a RTK augmented GNSS to measure track position in hump yard for the purpose of track profile measurement; determining $D_c$ mainline track across a wide area; and determining track occupancy probability independently of wired track circuits. Three railway measurement opportunities were investigated during the research.
\begin{enumerate}
\firmlist
	\item An automatic classification yard uses the force of gravity to propel cars through a complex of tracks to the intended destination in the yard. Environmental factors\footnote{Wind speed, direction, and ambient temperature} act on the motion of a railcar from its release, through a transit of specific yard tracks, to a final rest position. Profile deviation from the design grade due to settlement occurs over time from railcar loading forces and the effects of weather~\citep{2005szwilski}. Conducting a differential level survey across a 60 track, thousand car per day yard, places workers in harms way. Yard production delays are unavoidable to accommodate the safety of the survey party. The difficulty and expense in conducting a yard survey to quantify production delays attributable to grade irregularities are rare~\citep{2007barnes}. 
	
	A hump yard profile survey was conducted by locomotive equipped with RTK GPS survey instruments. The survey was conducted during production and inclement weather. The survey resulted in the production of 58 track profiles.
	
	\item Track superintendents rely on routine visual inspections to identify track defects for directing maintenance resources. RTK GNSS instrumentation holds the promise of recording track alinement during routine visual inspections by Hi-Rail. Track alinement history could provide insight into the identification of track shift or compliance irregularities attributable to car loading, weather, or geologic processes.
	
	Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RTK GNSS surveying instruments and a Virtual Reference Station server (VRS) were used during a track inspector's normal visual inspection by Hi-Rail to determine degree of curvature ${D_c}$. RTK instruments mounted to a Hi-Rail processed correctors from a VRS server, recording track position observations. A software modeling the string lining method~\citep{49CFR213D,2007FRATrack,2009bright}(hereafter referred to as \emph{the model}) determined ${D_c}$ and mile post reference locations. The RTK Hi-Rail $D_c$ were compared against rail company track charts to verify the model. The accuracy of the RTK Hi-Rail method for determining $D_c$ was compared against measurements by a specialized track inspection vehicle.
	
	\item Locating a train in a parallel, multi-track segment by means of GNSS requires a priori knowledge of each track segment's location. The present US rail transportation system inventory of 95,000 mainline track miles makes monumenting the absolute location of each track centerline to a high degree of accuracy a formidable task. Most rail company's have chosen LiDAR overflights to monument the position of track and wayside assets.
	
	Position of a mobile track vehicle using RTK GNSS determined a track reference position against which subsequent traverses by the mobile track vehicle where compared. Subsequent track positions by mobile track vehicle over met the FRA positioning requirements for a location determination system (LDS) as might be used for positive train control (PTC)~\citep[pp.3]{1995FRADiffe}.

\section{Research Questions}
The researcher sought to determine the viability of RTK GNSS augmentation to asses railway infrastructure and act as a reliable track vehicle locator capable of meeting the requirements of a location determination system as defined by the FRA. 

The solution to many track measurement and rail vehicle location problems requires absolute track and vehicle position measurement over wide areas. The research integrated RTK augmented GNSS measurement within the operational and safety constraints of a Class I rail company for the purpose of developing a method to survey track location with common track vehicles. The rail transportation problems addressed by the research seek to decrease on-track worker hazard exposure, increase track inspection efficiency, and reduced the cost of track measurement. The research employed locomotives and HiRail vehicles equipped with COTS GNSS survey equipment to evaluate the relative vertical precision, horizontal accuracy, and position reliability of RTK augmentation. The research attempted to use an RTK GNSS measurement system to meet the ``...high integrity, and high reliability for safety-critical train control applications~\citep[pp.11]{2008USDoT_NDGPS}.''

Objectives of the research developed procedures and supporting models for assessment of RTK augmented GNSS integration within a Class I railroad environment.
\begin{enumerate}
\firmlist
\item A literature review of previous rail survey experimental results as well as intellectual property claims were used to investigate factors that indicated the need for  research into the use of RTK augmented GNSS over railways.
\item Experts in the field of hump yard engineering were interviewed, and a review of the literature was used to identify methods of increasing humpyard efficiency and throughput. Railcar motion was studied through a humpyard in an effort to identify operational problems that may be related to profile degradation.
\item A method was developed and demonstrated to safely and precisely determine track grades across the bowl area of an automatic classification yard. The use of COTS RTK GPS instruments were evaluated aboard a locomotive during humping operations. Individual profiles for each bowl track in the yard were produced. The relative vertical precision of the mobile receiver and the signals recorded by a reference station in the yard were evaluated for evidence of signal distortions due to the radio-reflective environment of a hump yard.
\item Experts in the field of track inspection and wide area RTK augmentation delivery were interviewed to identify methods for measuring rail position over wide areas of mainline track.
\item A method was developed and demonstrated for safely determining horizontal track alinement across a wide area.
\item A model was developed to determine horizontal track alinement based on the string lining method using RTK GNSS observations. Factors affecting GNSS measurement over mainline track were analyzed.
\item A methodology was developed to assess RTK GNSS as part of a location determination system suitable for supporting positive train control. COTS RTK GNSS VRS infrastructure and instrumentation were evaluated in parallel multi-track mainline segments for the ability to meet FRA tolerances~\cite[4-5]{1995FRADiffe}.
\end{enumerate}

% Research Contribution
%Significance
Development and demonstration of RTK augmented GNSS is significant to providing the rail industry with a practical and reliable standard of absolute rail position measurement over a wide area. Several tools were developed enabling railway infrastructure measurement and monitoring that has not been demonstrated with US government provided GPS augmentation. Intelligent rail transportation initiatives will benefit from survey-quality positioning in the command, control, communications, and track information domains. Freight transportation will derive benefit from  improved power and braking systems which will result in improved energy efficiency and decreased emissions; improved systems for track defect detection and track movement prediction; improved efficiency in the deployment of maintenance assets; examination of track substructure through determination of the track modulus between lightly loaded (as with a HiRail) and loaded (as with a locomotive) track measurements; and safety improvements derived from Positive Train Control (PTC) systems with the potential to significantly reduce the probability of collisions between trains, casualties to roadway workers, damage to equipment, and reduction in the occurrence of overspeed accidents through the wireless differentiation of track vehicle location over parallel multi-track segments.

Reliable wireless measurement of track position, when contrasted with the present use of dedicated track circuits\footnote{i.e., insulated track circuits, loop detectors, magnetic proximity switches, transponders}, provides and opportunity to use RTK GNSS to enhance railway infrastructure management practices. Track vehicle location and control benefits from RTK GNSS coupled with utilization of existing wayside wireless infrastructure has the potential to provide economic benefit by reducing a rail company's dependance on existing hard-wired infrastructure\footnote{Estimated replacement mainline cost of \$125,000 per mile $\times$ 95,000 miles = \$12 billion~\citep{ResorPTC}} and attendant labor costs.

Other cited benefits of accurate train location may include:

	\item Reduced fuel consumption, through better pacing of trains (avoiding the need to take away momentum through braking and restore it through use of diesel power).
	\item More efficient use of existing physical plant, increasing effective capacity while avoiding further outlays to build additional tracks or sidings.~\citep[pp.12-13]{1995FRADiffe}

	\item Hump yard: This study specifically refers to the Hamlet Terminal, owned by CSX and located in Hamlet, North Carolina.

	\item Mainline track: A track extending through yards and between stations which must not be occupied without authority or protection. This study refers to mainline track as C\&O Ohio Subdivision from mile post (MP) 211 to MP 207 (Guyendotte, West Virginia), and C\&O Kanawha Subdivision from MP494 to MP 523 (Barborsville, WV to Russell, KY).

	\item Mapping-grade accuracy: An observed position within 3-16 feet (1-5 meters)  horizontally and 6-33 feet (2-10 meters) vertically of the true value with 95\% confidence.

	\item Survey-grade accuracy: The combined measurement errors from instrumentation and the measurement process producing a position to within 0.1 feet or less in the horizontal and vertical plane of the true value with 95\% confidence.

	\item Track occupancy: FRA LDS specification for differentiating between parallel tracks with a 11.50 foot centerline-to-centerline track spacing using GPS. The FRA track spacing requirement is interpreted in this study as a point obtained from a mobile track vehicle no greater than $\pm\frac{11.50}{2}$ feet left or right of a track reference point (i.e., centerline), with 99.999\% confidence~\cite[pp.6-7]{1995FRADiffe}.
