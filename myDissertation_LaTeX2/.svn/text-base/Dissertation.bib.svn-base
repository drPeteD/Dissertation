	Abstract = {This report presents findings an assessment of the user base and applications of the Nationwide Differential GPS (NDGPS) system.},
	Annote = {From Executive Summary Overview of Effort and Methods
The specific objective of this report is to present the results of an assessment of the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) system. The goals of this assessment were to document: 
	the current status of the NDGPS system; 
	current and projected NDGPS user base and applications, with the primary emphasis on assessing transportation system requirements; and 
	economic costs and benefits associated with continued NDGPS deployment and operations.

This assessment also addresses the potential impact of ceasing NDGPS operations on current and projected NDGPS users and applications, and the costs and benefits of ceasing operations. This assessment was performed by ARINC Incorporated, and its subcontractor SEAM, who are independent of NDGPS or other GPS service or equipment providers, and who have no business position relative to any decisions regarding NDGPS development, operation, or maintenance operation. Data was gathered in the generation of this report by a combination of: 
	contacts directly with end users; 
	a survey of Federal agencies; 
	evaluation of responses to the Federal Register Notice on NDGPS (RITA-2007-28836); 
	evaluation of responses to a survey by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO); 
	contacts at trade shows and conferences; 
	information from papers and presentations; and 
	information from web sites of user organizations, associations and user communities, suppliers, applications developers, Federal/state/local agencies, and others.

This report does not address details of the design or operation of NDGPS, but focuses on the user base, applications, associated economics, and the impacts of discontinuing NDGPS operation.},

	Annote = {Positive Train Control (PTC) systems are integrated command, control, communications, and information systems for controlling train movements with safety, security, precision, and efficiency. PTC systems will improve railroad safety by significantly reducing the probability of collisions between trains, casualties to roadway workers and damage to their equipment, and over speed accidents. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has named PTC as one of its "most-wanted" initiatives for national transportation safety. PTC systems are comprised of digital data link communications networks, continuous and accurate positioning systems such as NDGPS, on-board computers with digitized maps on locomotives and maintenance-of-way equipment, in-cab displays, throttle-brake interfaces on locomotives, wayside interface units at switches and wayside detectors, and control center computers and displays. PTC systems may also interface with tactical and strategic traffic planners, work order reporting systems, and locomotive health reporting systems. PTC systems issue movement authorities to train and maintenance-of-way crews, track the location of the trains and maintenance-of-way vehicles, have the ability to automatically enforce movement authorities, and continually update operating data systems with information on the location of trains, locomotives, cars, and crews. The remote intervention capability of PTC will permit the control center to stop a train should the locomotive crew be incapacitated. In addition to providing a greater level of safety and security, PTC systems also enable a railroad to run scheduled operations and provide improved running time, greater running time reliability, higher asset utilization, and greater track capacity. They will assist railroads in measuring and managing costs and in improving energy efficiency. Pilot versions of PTC were successfully tested a decade ago, but the systems were never deployed on a wide scale. Other demonstration projects are currently in the planning and testing stages. Deployment of PTC on railroads is expected to begin in earnest later this decade.},

	Abstract = {The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Research and Development sponsored a research
investigation to improve DGPS signal reception in the locomotive electromagnetic interference (EMI)
environment. The main objective of this investigation was to test whether a new Starlink p rototype E-field antenna designed to significantly reduce EMI effects surrounding operating AC and DC locomotives performed as intended (see Figure 1). During the testing, the performance of the Starlink prototype balanced E-field cone antenna was compared to that of a standard off-the-shelf Starlink H-field loop antenna (MBA2). The antennas were placed in various locations on the roof of the test locom otives. Overall, the Starlink E-field cone antenna performed significantly better than the off-the-shelf Starlink H-field loop antenna, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 10 dB. It was determined by prior tests that a 10 dB increase in the SNR is sufficient for the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) Service to work effectively on railroads. The NDGPS Service will broadcast differential correctors for GPS throughout the nation on the radio beacon band 285 kHz - 325 kHz.},

technological advances have increased the value of this information by simplifying its
storage, modification, access and distribution. With this new technology people throughout
the company have controlled and timely access to information that influences the reliability

This paper describes the process being used by CSX to consolidate data from legacy
systems into a new database using current technology. It also describes how the transition
provided the opportunity to create a unified information repository for the many
departments that make up CSX. In addition, CSX required that the existing system remain
operational during the project.
This project has been divided into a number of steps in order to minimize the impact of
the new system. The first step was to move a data snapshot from the legacy track chart
system to electronic track chart and information system. The next step allows the current
CSX data systems to provide continuous data updates to this new system. This track chart system and the accompanying relational database become the informational skeleton for
tying together additional organization information.},

	Abstract = {As the areas of Positive Train Control, Intelligent Braking Applications and the need for
accurate railroad GIS databases continues to grow, so will the need to provide accurate
track positioning information. The Federal Railroad Administration Office of Research
and Development has sponsored an initiative to develop the approach for a rail borne
track-mapping system to help meet the current and future needs of such positioning
systems. The goal of this approach is to offer a cost saving alternative to remote
sensing surveys from an aerial platform -- specifically to reduce the costs associated
with data collection. Various technologies and approaches were evaluated and tested
under FRA sponsorship. The decision was made to utilize a vehicle mounted, inertial
aided Video/GPS data collection system augmented by publicly available GPS
correction services. In August 2005, the selected technologies and approach were
tested in a collaborative effort between Norfolk Southern (NS), Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA), South Carolina Geodetic Survey (SCGS), Lockheed Martin
(LMCO), New York Air Brake (NYAB), Geo-3D and ENSCO to assess the accuracy and
logistics of the technology. The paper will address the results of this test.},

@techreport{1995FRADiffe,
	Abstract = {The Global Positioning System (GPS) data available to civilian users is not
sufficiently accurate to meet the safety-related needs of transportation users.
The United States Coast Guard is deploying a differential correction service for
GPS to enable precision navigation in harbors and inland waterways.
Railroads are exploring use of this differential GPS service as a location
determination system in emerging communication-based train control systems.
FRA strongly supports development and implementation of communicationbased
positive train control systems. Such systems have the potential to
significantly enhance railroad safety and to provide many additional benefits,
including full exploitation of potential line capacity by freight and passenger
railroads. Such systems can also lower the cost of train control for new highspeed
rail service.

The two primary train location systems that have been actively considered for
use in communication-based train control systems are based on differential
GPS and transponders. North American railroads are exploring use of both of
these location determination systems. At the present time, differential GPS
appears to have the advantage of lower initial cost (e.g., all necessary
hardware can be placed on the locomotive) and less maintenance (e.g.,
transponders can be damaged by vandalism or routine track work). The
Burlington Northern Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad have joined
together to develop a Positive Train Separation (PTS) Pilot Project on their lines
in the States of Washington and Oregon that will employ differential GPS as the
primary location determination system.},
	Annote = {3.0 Competing Technologies for Determining Train Location
Presently, there are a limited number of options for selection of a primary LDS. Although information from existing signal systems may be helpful for confirming train location, signal systems are not in place on track constituting about half of the road miles operated. Further, block occupancy derived from a signal system will not provide precise location within a block, speed, or direction of movement. In addition, many existing systems, or portions of them, are automatic, i.e., operate in the field without central direction or communication--so information from them is not now available at any central location.
Two primary train location systems are currently under development for railroad use: transponders and augmented GPS.
